                <p class="body-text">I have a specific approach for women unhappy with their drinking. If you wish to explore your current alcohol use or find this is having a negative effect on any area of your life, you might like to consider a bespoke programme. Alcohol support groups and AA provide an important service, but past experience has shown me that many people prefer the privacy and space of individual support and, of course, access to encouragement at the times that you need it most.</p>
