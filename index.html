                    Counselling is not a magic cure but I believe facing problems and talking them through with an unbiased professional, who is trained to help you think differently can only help.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Jo Tucker</h2>
                <p class="body-text">I am a BACP accredited counsellor and supervisor very experienced in both my profession and with life in general.
                    My previous work has included time as a school counsellor, working for an inner London drug and alcohol agency, work with Rape Crisis, managing and working with a hospice counselling service, corporate work with a global Employee Assistant Programme and work for a community based counselling service.        
                    All of this experience has prepared me to give back my valuable experience and knowledge within my own private work.             
                    There are very few things that I am not prepared for or have some experience in and I am very competent in both assessment and where necessary referral for specialist services.                 
                    Above all of this I have had my fare share of turbulent times in life and my own experience of the value of finding the right person at a hard time to help you navigate they way forward- and I bring a wealth of empathy, humour and honesty to my work.

                            In my numerous roles I have become skilled at gauging how I might best help you. I have many options available and I will probably use a variety of these with you.
                            These options will include my person entered grounding of non judgemental listening, empathy and understanding. With a more active element of CBT to help you retrain your thoughts.         
                            We might spend some time on compassion and mindfulness which I am a great advocate of. And possibly we will bring in elements of solution focused techniques, trauma work, or perhaps grief work- what ever it is I will bring my own style to it. I am based in Flackwell Heath between Beaconsfield and High Wycombe.
                        Just off junction 3a of the M40
                        I work from my discreet garden office set beneath the trees in a non domestic location.
                        There is plenty of parking outside.</p>
